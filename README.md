Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio to showcase my coding skills, my passions, and what I've been working on lately.

It also features links to some of my professional pages on LinkedIn and GitHub as well as a link to contact me directly.  

It was created with HTML and CSS using VSCode as the editor.

Thank you for checking it out, and look out for more new additions as I progress through the bootcamp!
